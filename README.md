1) I think that the Blog Post Component which appears in a list at the /blog endpoint could be wrapped in a box, which would make it stand out more - just like with the CATEGORIES box next to the list of Blog Post Components. This way it will appear as more than just a boring piece of text and an image.

2) I am going to put the texts and image in the boxes, and design it in a way that is similar to the page's one. I am also planning on adding a little bit more texture to the component's visuals. This will be a good change as the user will see the Blog Post as a more engaging and tidy component.

3) Given more time I would add small, but UX improving animations like one which lacks 'GET QUOTE ONLINE' button popup. And fix a little bug in Footer display on Mobile - Payment types display in the column with no gap between them. I would spend my time improving little, but important details.
